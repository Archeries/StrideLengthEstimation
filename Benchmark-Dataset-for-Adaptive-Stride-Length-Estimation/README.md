# Benchmark-Dataset-for-Adaptive-Stride-Length-Estimation
The lack of benchmarking datasets for pedestrian stride length estimation makes it hard to pinpoint differences of published methods. Existing datasets either lack the ground-truth of each stride or are limited to small spaces with single scene or motion pattern. To fully evaluate the performance of proposed ASLE algorithm, we conducted benchmark dataset for natural pedestrian dead reckoning using smartphone sensors and FM-INS module. we leveraged the FM-INS module(X-IMU) to provide the ground-truth of each stride with motion distance errors in 0.3% of the entire travel distance. The datasets were obtained from a group of healthy adults with natural motion patterns (fast walking, normal walking, slow walking, running, jumping). The datasets contained more than 22 km, 10000 strides of gait measurements. The datasets cover both indoor and outdoor cases, including: stairs, escalators, elevators, office environments, shopping mall, streets and metro station. To maximize compatibility, all data is published in open and simple file formats. The sensor is sampled at 100 Hz. Throughout the datasets, the users hold the phone in their hand in front of their chest. The samples hold nine degree-of-freedom sensor data and the corresponding stride number, stride length and total walking distance.
